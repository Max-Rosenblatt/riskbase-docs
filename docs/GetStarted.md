##### An internet connection is required to download assets

Users responsible for large numbers of assets can choose to manually manage their downloaded assets.

It's up to the user how they manage their assets. A Fire Risk Assessor who performs an FRA once per year might only download an asset when an FRA is due, removing the asset when the FRA is complete. A housing manager who makes regular visits to buildings will likely keep all their assets downloaded on their device.
