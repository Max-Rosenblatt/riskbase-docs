> The app remembers your filter preferences. This saves approvers from filtering for submitted assessments each time they open the app.

> Remember to check which filters you have turned on if a specific assessment is missing from your list.

> Viewing and approving assessments in the app is the first step towards our feature-packed, collaborative quality assurance workflow.

> Currently, the findings in QC are read-only, and for changes to be made, assessments must be Unsubmitted and returned to In-Progress.
>
> Our next release will enable a validator to edit findings, add comments and notes throughout an assessment, and return to the assessor to primp and polish.

>
> Approved assessments have a version number which appears on the cover and summary pages of its PDF report. This number refers to the number of times it has been approved.
