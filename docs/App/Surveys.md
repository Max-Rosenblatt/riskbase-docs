# Surveys

RiskBase door surveys have three steps:

* **Collect Specification** during initial survey. Review and modify this information during subsequent surveys.
* **Check Condition** (if accessible) each time the door is included in a survey.
* **Recommend Remedial Actions** (if required) based on the findings of the condition check.

> While tablets and smartphones are both great tools for collecting door data, we find a growing number of surveyors opt for the more compact smartphone to move efficiently around a site.

##### Link A QR Code

It's common for surveyors to attach QR code labels to doors. The QR code labels can be linked to door data held in RiskBase. Once linked, a unique QR code label can be scanned by a surveyor, during a future survey, to recall a particular door.

Depending on the kind of survey and your level of access; some of the fields will be editable, while other will be read-only.

You make changes to any editable field. The changes to this information will be updated on the asset, once the survey has been approved.

Whether a door is locked, the occupant does not answer or the occupant declines access, it's important to document any issues accessing doors during your surveys.

You may be able to perform a visual inspection and collect some information but you won't be able to ascertain key condition information, such as: Does the door closer work correctly? or Are intumescent seals fitted and in good condition?

Use the question **Inspection Type** to document the level of access achieved.
