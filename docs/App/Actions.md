##### You can customise the due date for your actions

In our assessments, each action's timescale is associated with a predefined duration.

When suggesting a remedial action, you have the flexibility to customise the default due date linked to that timescale. This feature is particularly valuable when clients have specific time requirements or when you find it necessary to set an alternative due date.

> The default Due Date is 'Based on Timescale', but you also have the following alternatives:
>
> * Custom Timescale: Tailor the timescale in terms of days, weeks, months, or years.
> * Custom Date: Input a specific date according to your requirements.

##### Floor plans, Elevation Plans, Environs Plans

Add value to your risk assessments by identifying the locations of remedial works on floor plans, elevation plans and environmental plans.

##### Add Estimated Costs to your Actions

When adding an action in your assessment, you have the option to include estimated costs for completing the remedial action.

This proves especially beneficial if your team is handling the remedial works, allowing you to seamlessly integrate pricing into the assessment process rather than addressing it separately.

This approach not only streamlines your workflow but also provides an overview of costs associated with the remedial works for the client.

If none of the Suggested Control Measures and/or Actions are relevant, you can add custom ones.
