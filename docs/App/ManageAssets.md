# Manage Assets

> **An internet connection is required to download assets**.
>
> Users responsible for large numbers of assets can choose to manually manage their downloaded assets.
>
> It's up to the user how they manage their assets. A Fire Risk Assessor who performs an FRA once per year might only download an asset when an FRA is due, removing the asset when the FRA is complete. A housing manager who makes regular visits to buildings will likely keep all their assets downloaded on their device.
