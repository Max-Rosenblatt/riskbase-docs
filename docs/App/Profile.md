Add an extra layer of security to your RiskBase account by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).

After enabling MFA on your account, you're required to enter an authentication code during sign-in. The authentication code is generated by a MFA app on a device you own. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they have access to the MFA app on your device.

**Enable Multi-factor Authentication**

1. Press _Settings_ to go to the settings tab (bottom right).
   - Tablet: Your profile is on the right.
   - Smartphone: Press on your photo (or initials) to go to your profile.
1. Press _Multi-factor-Authentication, Setup now..._ and choose one of the following:
   - **Setup Automatically** Choose this option to automatically open the MFA app on your device and get setup. Only available on some devices.
   - **Show QR Code** Choose this option to display a QR code; manually scan this QR code with your MFA app to get setup.
   - **Show and Copy Secret** Choose this option to copy your MFA secret; you can then manually paste the secret into your MFA app to get setup.
1. Once you've successfully added your RiskBase account to your MFA app, enter the code the app shows into RiskBase.
