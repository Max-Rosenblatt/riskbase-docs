> Fields can be set up to only appear based on the response to other fields, e.g.
>

    * **No** - no other fields are shown.
    * **Yes** - additional fields **Alarm description** and **Alarm Panel location** appear.

Organise the different types of information into sections. Information appears in these sections on the app and on reports.

In the example below, **Asset Information** holds details about the Building, Occupancy, Use and Fire Equipment. There is a seperate section for **Doors** which holds the specification and conditional information of each Fire Door at a property.

When you need to record and store data on multiples of the same item as in a Fire Door survey, use **Repeatable Fields**.  

![Repeatable Fields](/img/support/app/fieldsetup/repeatablefields.webp)

Using the Fire Doors Survey example, everytime you *<i class="fa-light fa-plus"></i>* a door, all the fields in a group are generated and asked of the new door. The findings of repeatable fields can be detailed within the asset information of a report or formatted in it's own section in the case of a door, compartmentation or exterior wall survey.


**Create a New Group of Repeatable Fields**

1. Press *<i class="fa-light fa-plus"></i>* Group*.
1. Give the group a name.
1. Check *Repeatable*.
1. **Singular Name** appears. If the group is called 'Fire Doors', the singular name could be 'Door'. Provide the singular name.
1. Press *Add* - top, right.

**Add Fields to the Repeatable Field Group**

1. Press *<i class="fa-light fa-plus"></i>* Add field*.
1. See [Create New Field](#create-new-field)

Include your fields in your assessments.

Add and update information about your asset alongside answering questions and adding actions and controls. This makes completing risk assessments more efficient because you no longer need to leave the assessment to add static information about an asset.

![Fields in Assessments](/img/support/updates/fieldsinassessments/fieldsinassessments.webp "Fields in Assessments")

> Field information can now be added/edited during an assessment and gets saved to the asset when the assessment is Approved.
