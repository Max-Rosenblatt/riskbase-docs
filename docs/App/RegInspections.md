# Regular Inspections

##### It's very important to submit your inspections

You can inspect as many doors as you like in a RiskBase inspection but once you are done for the day, you must:

1. Submit your inspection.
2. Sync your device.
3. Ensure the sync has completed before closing the RiskBase app.

> Once submitted, the information gathered in your inspection will be saved in the RiskBase cloud. The next inspector to visit the building, whether that's you or a colleague, will have the most up-to-date information to work with.

Regular inspections of a property and its elements such as fire doors, alarm control panels, lifts, and other safety-related features are crucial to ensuring the safety and functionality of the building. These inspections help in identifying potential hazards, ensuring compliance with safety regulations, and maintaining the proper functioning of essential systems.

##### RiskBase enables responsible organisations to

* Follow a predefined schedule for inspections based on manufacturer recommendations, industry standards, and regulatory requirements.
* Utilise competent, internal staff as well as external consultants to complete the inspections.
* Keep detailed records of inspections, repairs, and maintenance activities for documentation and compliance purposes.

##### Everything in a property is an 'Element'

* Alarm Control Panel.
* Communal Area.
* Communal Fire Door.
* Fire Door.
* Fire Stopping Finding.
* Lifts.
* Suppression Systems.
* Etc.

RiskBase enables you to build a structured database or information management system that contains detailed information about the elements in a building or infrastructure project. It serves as a central repository for storing, managing, and accessing crucial information about various components, materials, equipment, and systems.

Regular assessments are integral to effective asset management. These assessments involve evaluating the condition of each asset or element within a building or infrastructure to determine its current state and identify any necessary remediation or maintenance needs.

##### The assessment process typically includes

* **Condition Evaluation** Inspecting and assessing the physical condition of each asset. This could involve visual inspections, measurements, tests, or utilizing sensors for data collection.
* **Data Collection** Gathering relevant data related to the asset's performance, age, usage, and any issues encountered during its operation.
* **Analysis** Analyzing collected data to determine the asset's current state, potential risks, and any deterioration or malfunctions.
* **Identifying Remediation Needs** Based on the assessment findings, identifying necessary remediation actions such as repairs, replacements, upgrades, or maintenance activities required to address any issues or deterioration observed.
* **Prioritization** Prioritizing remediation actions based on criticality, safety concerns, impact on operations, or cost-effectiveness.
* **Documentation and Reporting** Documenting assessment results, remediation plans, and creating reports to communicate findings to relevant stakeholders.

By incorporating regular assessments into the asset management process, the element register can be updated with the latest information about the condition of each element. This helps in proactive maintenance planning, cost-effective decision-making, and ensuring that assets are functioning optimally throughout their lifecycle. Moreover, it assists in predicting potential issues and avoiding unexpected failures, contributing to improved operational efficiency and cost savings.

##### Communal Fire Doors vs Flat Entrance Doors

The Fire Safety England Regulations require that both Fire Doors and Flat Entrance Doors are inspected on a regularly.

* Fire Doors require a *Quarterly Check*
* Flat Entrance Doors require an *Annual Check*

##### Best Endeavours

It will not always be possible to perform full inspections of fire doors and flat entrance doors in a given period due to lack of access.

The goal of best endeavours is to ensure that reasonable efforts have been made to gain access to the doors to complete the inspections. This means it's important to record every 'attempted but not completed' inspection of each door.

At the end of a period, whether three or twelve months, the best endeavours can be demonstrated and reported on.

##### Link a QR Code to the element

1. Attach a RiskBase QR Code label to the element.
1. Inside the RiskBase app inspection, press on the QR field.
1. Point your devices camera to the QR Code label.

This will create a link between the physical element and the data held in RiskBase.

At the end of an inspection in which multi-author has been used, ensure that every author syncs their device before one of the authors submits the inspection.

##### Submit your inspection at the end of each visit

A regular check or inspection provides a snap shot of the elements inspected that day.

It is important to submit an inspection at the end of every visit to the site to ensure the data held in RiskBase is always up to date.

When the next inspection is undertaken, which could be the following day, week or month, inspectors need to be able to:
