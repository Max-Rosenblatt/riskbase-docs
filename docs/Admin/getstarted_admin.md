Properties, buildings, premises; however you refer to them, these are your RiskBase assets.

Control Panels, Doors, Flats, Stairwells and Storeys are all referred to as 'Elements'.

We refer to an 'Instance' when we talk about individual elements e.g. flat 23 and flat 24 are both 'instances' of a flat 'element'.
