##### Sub-processors and the GDPR

At RiskBase we take privacy and data security very seriously. The personal information we store is relatively limited but fundamentally we treat all data as private and move it around as little as possible.

There are two key roles that we undertake under the GDPR, firstly as a data controller, and secondly as a data processor. As a data controller, we hold some personal data especially that relating to our customers and users. How we manage that is explained in our Privacy Policy.

As a data processor we also process data that our customers and users create or add to the RiskBase platform. We may use sub-processors to store or manage or interact with that data. Who we employ to do that is listed below.
