We bill on the 1st of the month.

You'll receive an email summarising the previous periods unbilled assessments, task management access and one-off charges.

Invoices arrive on the first of the month and we request that you make payment within 28 days. Payment is made by bank transfer. Our banking details are provided on the invoice.

**We'll Let You Know When We Receive Your Payments**

When we receive your payment, a thank you email will be sent so you know it arrived safely.

**We'll Remind You To Pay**

If you make payment within 14 days of the invoice being issued, you won't get any reminders.

* We'll remind you on the 14th, 14 days before payment is overdue. This is polite nudge to help you plan your payments.
* If the payment becomes overdue which means we haven't received it within 28 days of issuing your invoice, we'll let you know and advise you that your RiskBase account will be paused if payment isn't received within the next 14 days.
* At 42 days or 14 days overdue, RiskBase will pause your account. You won't be able to sign-in, perform assessments, manage assets, or download reports. In this case, no data would be deleted, and full access would be restored as soon as we received your payment.
