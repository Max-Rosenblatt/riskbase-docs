terms of the Agreement will not breach any laws, infringe any person’s Intellectual Property Rights or other rights or give
rise to any cause of action against RiskBase in any jurisdiction.

**6.7** RiskBase shall have no liability for any disclosure or unauthorised access to Customer Data caused by any third party.

**6.8** It is acknowledged and agreed that an End Client will always be entitled to access and manage its own End Client Data and

legal process is levied against any of its assets which is not discharged or paid out in full within three days or if any event
analogous to any of the foregoing shall occur in any jurisdiction in which the other party is incorporated, resident or carries
on business.
