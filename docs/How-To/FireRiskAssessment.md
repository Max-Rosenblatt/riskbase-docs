##### Checklists and Questions

Checklists and questions have several functions. They are used to:

* prompt assessors.
* identify remedial actions and control measures.
* demonstrate to the customer the considerations made during an assessment.

A checklist is used when there are multiple considerations. Checklists are a list of statements that can be agreed or disagreed with. Checklists are quick, efficient and easy for customers to understand on PDF reports.

Questions are often used when the answer is not a straight forward yes or no.

Checklists and questions can be combined in the same assessment template.

##### Answer a Checklist

1. Press on a checklist.
1. Press the *<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>* if you agree with the statement, press the *<i class="fa-solid fa-x"></i>* if you disagree with the statement or press the *<i class="fa-solid fa-dash"></i>* if the statement is not relevant.
