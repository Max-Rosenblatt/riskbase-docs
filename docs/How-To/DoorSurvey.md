> ##### Avoid creating duplicate doors
>
> If the door you are inspecting already exists in RiskBase, you must not duplicate it. It's important to have single record of each door in RiskBase, in-order to maintain the golden thread of data.  

##### Add a Photo of a door

1. Press on the photo field.
1. Use your devices camera to take a photo or select a photo from your devices photo library.
1. Press *Use Photo*.

Photos can be updated at a later date but it's worth capturing a high-quality image so future visitors to the element can easily identify it.

##### Link a QR Code to a door

1. Attach a RiskBase QR Code label to the element.
1. Inside the RiskBase app inspection, press on the QR field.
1. Point your devices camera to the QR Code label.

This will create a link between the physical element and the data held in RiskBase.

> In the case of a fire door, it's common to attach the label to the hinge side door jam to keep the labels descreet. It's down to each organisation where they choose to attach the labels.

##### Drop a Pin to identify the door's location

1. Press on the Pin field.
1. Select the relevant floor plan.
1. Tap on the screen to drop the pin.
1. Pinch to zoom and drag the pin around to refine the location.

> There is no requirement to record every piece of information on an initial visit. Information in RiskBase is designed to be reviewed and built upon over time.
>
> If floor plans are not available or you don't yet have QR Code labels, skip these steps.

##### Record information about a door

Each element has a set of fields to record the specific information required. Field types include: text, drop-down, number, date, time or image.

1. Fill in the information you can.
1. Do not provide any information unless you are sure of the accuracy.  

> There is no requirement to record every piece of information on an initial visit. Information in RiskBase is designed to be reviewed and built upon over time.
>
> If you don't feel qualified to provide any of the information requested, leave the fields blank. This information can be filled in at a later date.  

##### Record when you didn't gain access to a door

1. Press on *Annual Check* or *Quarterly Check*.
1. Press on *Attempted But Not Completed*.
1. Provide remarks to explain why the inspection couldn't be completed.

##### Assess the Condition of a door

1. Press on the condition check.
1. Work through the checklist of considerations, agreeing or disagreeing with the statements. Relevant actions are suggested as the checklist is completed.

> ##### Remedial Actions
>
> If you identify any issues or hazards, you must recommend remedial actions.

##### Add Recommended Actions

1. Scroll down to view suggested actions.
1. Press on a suggested action.
1. Update the 'what to do' and 'why to do it' text fields, category, severity and timescale if required.
1. Take or attach photos if appropriate.
1. Press *Save*.

##### Collaborate with colleagues

When more than one person is on-site performing door surveys at the same time, use Multi Author to collaborate and contribute to the same survey.

It is important not to create two separate surveys at the same time because of the risk of duplication. By contributing to the same survey, colleagues can keep track of each other's progress.

##### Add Authors

1. Press on the *Assessment Overview* at the top of the survey screen.
1. Scroll down to the multi-author sections.
1. Press on the blue *Add Author* link.
1. Select one or more of your colleagues.
1. Press *Done*.
1. Additional authors can now press on your In-Progress survey.

At the end of an survey in which multi-author has been used, ensure that every author syncs their device before one of the authors submits the survey.

##### Submit an survey

1. Scroll to the top of the survey screen and press *Submit*.
1. When prompted press *Submit* again to confirm you have completed the survey.
1. Sync your device to ensure data is shared with the cloud.
